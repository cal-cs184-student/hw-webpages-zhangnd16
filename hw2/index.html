      <h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

      <h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
      De Casteljau's algorithm is an iterative method to generate Bezier curves.
      Given a list of n vertices and a lerp value \(0 &lt t &lt 1\), for each
      pair of adjacent vertices, generate n-1 intermediate lerp vertices.
      Iteratively perform this step until n=1, where there is the final point on
      the Bezier curve. Repeat the process for all t values between 0 and 1, and
      the set of all final points consist to the desired Bezier curve.

      <p>
        Below is a Bezier curve with 6 control points and another slightly
        different modified one.
      </p>

      <h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
      To generate a Bezier surface on a set of n * n control points, consider n
      Bezier curve generated with n rows, each row with n control points. Taking
      the point on each Bezier curve with parameter u, one can generate another
      Bezier curve using these points as control points. With a parameter v, one
      can calculate a point on the "second-order" Bezier curve, which is on the
      Bezier surface. With all possible (u, v), both between 0 and 1, one can
      generate all points to form the Bezier surface.

      <h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

      <h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
      To calculate the area-weighted vertex normals for a vertex, one should sum
      up all normal vectors of the faces around the vertex. To calculate the
      normal vector of one of the faces, start from one of the halfedge of the
      vertex, take the vertex of the halfedge, the vertex of the next halfedge
      (halfedge->next()), and the vertex of the second next halfedge
      (halfedge->next()->next()). These three vertices consist to the triangle
      face, and one can calculate the normal vector by taking cross product of
      the differences of these vectors.
      <br /><br />
      To traverse to the next face, take next halfedge of the halfedge's twin
      component (halfedge->twin()->next()). Repeat the process above for each
      face around the vertex and sum up the normal vectors, and normalize the
      sum to get the desired result.

      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <table
          style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse"
        >
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center">

            <td style="text-align: center">

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
      To perform an edge flip, notice that no new edges are created, therefore
      the assignments between halfedges and edges, also halfedges and their twin
      complements are unchanged after a edge flip. Therefore, we can just worry
      about next, vertex, face of halfedges, and the halfedge assignments of
      vertex and face. One should be very careful about the next component of
      the halfedge, and make sure that they form a proper loop within a face. I
      encountered a bug when I tried to flip an edge, the program just froze. It
      turns out to be that I was not following the halfedge's next assignments,
      and I did not the proper halfedge's next pointer to the flipped halfedge,
      therefore causing an infinite loop.

          style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse"
        >
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center">
              <img src="task4_1.png" width="400px" />

            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center">
              <img src="task4_3.png" width="400px" />
              <figcaption>Teapot with more edge filps</figcaption>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
      To perform an edge split is more complicated than an edge flip, as many
      new elements are created. A new vertex, three new edges, six new
      halfedges, and two new faces are created and needed to be assigned to the
      proper elements. For this part, as things become more complicated, I just
      wrote down all parts that are in the given mesh and assigned everything
      needed to each component to avoid any potential bugs. I wrote each
      variable name as the example picture in the instruction (e.g.,
      halfedgebc). I also found a helper function to assign elements to halfedge
      is very helpful, as there are many repetitious similar assignments for
      halfedges.

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
      To perform loop subdivision, I follow the instructions to store the new
      positions into the old vertex and positions of new vertex into their
      corresponding edges and I found it much easier to traverse the mesh before
      the subdivision. Then, to split all edges in the original mesh and avoid
      splitting any new edges, I first record all edges into a vector and split
      all edges in that vector. To identify all new edges, after an edge
      splitting, find the edges that do not connect to an old vertex. After this
      is to flip all new edges connecting a new vertex and an old vertex. Last,
      update the positions of all vertices. I encountered a bug where all the
      new vertices ending up to have a position at the origin. It turns out that
      I assigned the new position to the position attribute of the new vertex,
      immediately after the edge flipping, which is overrided by the position
      updating later.

      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <table
          style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse"
        >
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center">
              <img src="task6_1.png" width="400px" />
              <figcaption>Original bean</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: center">
              <img src="task6_2.png" width="400px" />
              <figcaption>Bean after one loop subdivision</figcaption>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      After loop subdivision, all sharp corners and edges become much smoother.
      This is because the position of the sharp vertices are taken average with
      less-sharp vertices adjacent to them. This effect can be reduced by
      pre-splitting all adjacent edges to sharp vertex. Below is an example of a
      loop subdivision on a cube,comparing with no pre-splitting, and with
      pre-splitting on each edge adjacent to the sharp vertex at the upper
      right. It is evident from the below that pre-splitting on edges near the
      sharp vertices can reduce the smoothing effect of loop division.

        <table

            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center">

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      From the above example, one can also notice that the cube becomes
      asymmetric after the loop division, despite the cube itself is symmetric
      around the origin. This is because the vertices-edges topology is not
      symmetric. One can preprocess the cube to make the vertices-edges topology
      symmetric with some edge splitting, and the resulting mesh after loop
      subdivision would become symmetric as desired.
